# Starting to work

hello!
We will be working together in this project. Please review the source code in full before starting. Do not take shortcuts, read the full content.
Please remember that we have the rules at .cursor/rules
We don't want shortcuts, we want to have ansible scripts working correctly all the time, no manual interventions required. If we need to investigate in an ssh session, please keep it at a minimum.
