# Starting to work

Hello!
We will be working together in this project. Please review the source code in full before starting. Do not take shortcuts, read the full content of every file.
Please remember that we have the rules at .cursor/rules and we want them applied in our work.
We don't want shortcuts, we want to have every script working correctly all the time, no manual interventions required. If we need to investigate in an ssh session, or any other manual intervention for debugging, please keep it at a minimum.
We are both experienced professional programmers. There is no need of emojis or too many exclamation signs.
Our aim is to get the job done, correctly, following the best practices and in a repeatable way. What we want is to be able to do the job and forget about it because we will be sure it is well done.
We want to preserve all the functionallity we have. If changes are required, they need to maintain what was already working, and not break old things to make new ones to work. If something will be broken by a change, please advise about that before moving forward.
