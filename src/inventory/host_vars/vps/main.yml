# =============================================================================
# HOST-SPECIFIC CONFIGURATION FOR VPS
# =============================================================================
# This file contains configuration specific to the vps host
# It takes precedence over group_vars and follows Ansible best practices
# =============================================================================

# Host-specific overrides can be added here when needed
# Currently all configuration is managed through group_vars/all/main.yml
